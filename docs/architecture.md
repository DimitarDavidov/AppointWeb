## Components

### Frontend (`src/App/ClientApp`)

- **React 19** SPA built with **Vite**
- **React Router** for page navigation with role-based protected routes
- **Redux Toolkit** for global auth state
- **Axios** HTTP client with JWT interceptor
- **SCSS** for styling

The frontend runs as a separate dev server during development. It calls the backend API directly over HTTP.

### Backend (`src/App`)

- **ASP.NET Core 9** Web API
- **Entity Framework Core** with PostgreSQL provider
- **JWT Bearer** authentication with role-based authorization
- Controllers handle HTTP requests; services contain business logic

On startup the API:

1. Verifies the database connection
2. Applies EF Core migrations automatically
3. Listens on port `8080`

### Database (`src/docker`)

- **PostgreSQL 16** running in Docker
- Started via `docker compose` — only the database is containerized
- Backend and frontend run natively on the host machine

## User roles

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Customer` | Browse services and book appointments |
| `Provider` | Manage service listings, **per-service** availability, and incoming bookings |
| `Admin` | Manage users (edit, suspend, delete) via the admin panel |

Users register as **Customer** or **Provider**. The **Admin** role is assigned manually (for example via the database).

## Request flow (example: login)

1. User submits the login form on `/login`
2. Frontend sends `POST /api/auth/login` with email and password
3. Backend validates credentials against the `Users` table
4. Backend returns a signed JWT plus username, email, and role
5. Frontend stores the token in Redux + `localStorage`
6. Subsequent API requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
7. Backend validates the JWT on protected endpoints

## Request flow (example: booking)

1. User browses the service catalog on `/`
2. User opens a service at `/book/:providerId/:serviceId`
3. If not logged in, they are redirected to `/login`
4. User picks a date/time and submits the booking form
5. Frontend sends `POST /api/appointments` with provider, service, and start time
6. Backend validates **service-specific** availability, prevents double-booking, and rejects self-booking
7. Appointment is created with status **Pending**; the provider receives a request email
8. Provider confirms via `PATCH /api/appointments/{id}/confirm` → status becomes **Booked**; the customer receives a confirmation email
9. Customer can view and manage the appointment at `/appointments`

## Request flow (example: reschedule)

1. Customer or provider proposes a new time via `PATCH /api/appointments/{id}/reschedule`
2. Backend stores the proposed time in `pendingRescheduleStartTime` / `pendingRescheduleEndTime` and sets status to **Pending**
3. The other party receives an email notification
4. The other party accepts via `PATCH /api/appointments/{id}/reschedule/accept`
5. The party who requested the reschedule receives an acceptance email
6. If the appointment had a **confirmed** time before the request, reschedule counts and `previousStartTime` are updated; otherwise the change is treated as an initial time adjustment (not counted as a reschedule)
7. Status returns to **Booked** with the new time

## Request flow (example: provider panel)

1. A provider opens `/provider`
2. Frontend loads services from `GET /api/provider/services` and appointments from `GET /api/provider/appointments`
3. The dashboard shows a personalized greeting (based on the browser's local timezone), stat cards, and appointment tabs (Upcoming, Pending, Past, Cancelled)
4. From **My services**, the provider can add listings, edit service details, set **per-service booking hours**, and preview the public catalog page
5. Booking hours are loaded and saved via `GET/PUT /api/provider/services/{serviceId}/availability` — each service has its own schedule
6. Provider can confirm pending bookings, request/accept reschedules, cancel, and mark outcomes from the appointment tabs

## Request flow (example: password reset)

1. User opens `/forgot-password` and submits their email
2. Frontend sends `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`
3. Backend looks up user; if found, creates a hashed token and sends email
4. User clicks the link in the email → `/reset-password?token=...`
5. User enters a new password; frontend sends `POST /api/auth/reset-password`
6. Backend validates the token, updates the password, and marks the token as used

## Appointment lifecycle

```
Customer books → Pending
                    │
         Provider confirms
                    ▼
                 Booked ──────► Completed / NoShow (after end time)
                    │
        Cancel (customer/provider/admin)
                    ▼
                Cancelled

Reschedule request (from Pending or Booked):
  → status Pending with proposed new time
  → other party accepts → Booked (with new time)
  → requester receives acceptance email
  → reschedule counts updated only if there was a confirmed time before
```

## Backend layers

```
Controllers     →  HTTP endpoints, request validation, status codes
Services        →  Business logic (JWT, password reset, email, account deletion)
Data            →  DbContext, entity configurations, migrations
Models          →  Domain entities (User, Service, Appointment, etc.)
DTOs            →  Request/response shapes for the API
Middleware      →  Global error handling, suspended-user blocking
```

## Middleware

| Middleware | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` | Catches unhandled exceptions and returns JSON error responses |
| `SuspendedUserMiddleware` | Blocks suspended accounts with `403 Forbidden` on authenticated requests |

## CORS

The API allows requests from the Vite dev server:

- `http://localhost:5173`
- `https://localhost:5173`

Configured in `Program.cs` under the `AllowFrontend` policy.

## Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `appsettings.Development.json` | Connection string, JWT, email settings (gitignored) |
| `appsettings.Development.example.json` | Template to copy for local setup |
| `Properties/launchSettings.json` | Backend port (`8080`) |
| `src/docker/docker-compose.yml` | PostgreSQL credentials and port |

## Business rules (high level)

- Providers **cannot book their own services** (enforced in API and UI)
- The home catalog hides a logged-in provider's own listings from the browse grid
- Appointment lists are scoped by role: customers see their bookings, providers see bookings where they are the provider, admins see all
- Double-booking is prevented by application checks and a PostgreSQL exclusion constraint
- Suspended users cannot use authenticated endpoints
- New bookings start as **Pending** until the provider confirms them
- **Availability is per service** — each listing can have its own weekly hours; if none are set, any time is allowed
- Reschedule requests require acceptance by the other party; only changes from a previously confirmed slot count toward reschedule history
- Email notifications are sent for booking requests, appointment confirmations, cancellations, reschedule proposals, and accepted reschedules (SMTP in production, console logging when `Email:Host` is empty)
